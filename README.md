# MLHackathon
India ML hackathon challenge

# Approach 

# 1.Data Cleansing and Exploration
- Cleaning Data
- Found that Data was imbalanced. SO applied sampling techniues tog get balance data.
- Sampling tehniques used - undersampling, Random Over sampling , SMOTE .etc

# 2.Data Visualization
- Used Barplots to see distribution of features for each class
- Plot heatmap to find out mostly correlated features
- used Seaborn countplot to display count of each class for categorical features like finantial institution etc.

# 3.Feature Selection and Extraction
- Removed unwanted features like loan id
- based on heatmap remove highly correlated features
- Used PCA to extract top 10 components 
- Displayed each feature importance generated by random forest model
- Converted Cateorical features to numeric using One Hot Encoding

# 4.Building model
- Checked accuracy of different models like Random Forest, XGboost, LightGBM, Logistic regression, Naive Bays, KNN, Neural Network.
- Used Sklearn, Tensorlfow -GPU , keras, ensemle models libraries for model building

# 5.Validate Model
- Validated each model using F1_score, Recall, Precesion, Confusion matrics
- Model tends to overfitt data. Used Hypertunning parameters to reduce overfitting
- XGBoost (Boosting ensemble model) was working better with over sampling . Chose this as final predictive model.

# 6.Prediction
- Best prdictive model is used for submission.
